# Minecraft-Skyblock-multitool
# I was tired of starting every MC-Skyblock game of mining stacks of cobble, so I made this simple program with:
# Cobblestone Miner - mining cobblestone and automatically switching pickaxes from inventory
# Coarse dirt miner - from 1.16 update, Piglins barter gravel, which makes dirt renewable, 
# but it's quite annoying to put coarse dirt, turn it into path and mine it with stone shovels,
# so I made this simple mode, which place dirt, turn it into path with shovel and mine it
# (with switching resources from inventory)

# Program is in initial phase, i'll add more options and instructions in it's time
